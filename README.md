## Overview
The most famous kaggle project is the Titanic competition. The aim is simple: Predict the survivors of the Titanic disaster.

In this project i didn't spent a lot of on visualization. Instead, i tried to focus on the features and all i can get from them. 
Therefore most of the cell are about Feature engineering.
